                            It is with these <font style={{ color: "white" }}>Basic Biblical Beliefs</font> in mind that we have felt the calling to reach out to those who are <font style={{ color: "white" }}>lost and alone</font>. In the Bible, there is a story about a prodigal son, who took his inheritance, while his father was still alive, and went out into the world to discover himself. This young man, walked away from his father, family and everything he knew because he <font style={{ color: "white" }}>wanted something different</font>. But in doing this, he <font style={{ color: "white" }}>walked into a life of emptiness</font>. Now for a long time he was trying to find a place to fit in. He was trying to find a place where he would be accepted. He was trying to find something different, but <font style={{ color: "white" }}>all he found was emptiness</font>. It was in this moment where the Spirit of God stirred in him. It was in this moment where he began <font style={{ color: "white" }}>searching for a way back home</font>. He didnâ€™t know what that would look like. But as soon as he was in sight, <font style={{ color: "white" }}>his father went running to him</font>. These are the people we feel uniquely called to reach. We believe God has called us to reach out to those who have <font style={{ color: "white" }}>no connection</font> with God. This may mean they are unchurched, or maybe they have <font style={{ color: "white" }}>simply walked away at some point</font>, but these are the <font style={{ color: "white" }}>people we feel called to reach</font>
